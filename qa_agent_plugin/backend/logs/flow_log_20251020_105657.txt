🤔 Decision Analysis:
   • Should Call Tool: True
   • Number of Tool Calls: 2
   • Needs More Data: False
   • Final Answer Ready: True
   • Confidence: 95.0%

🛠️ Tool Calls Decided:
   1. generate_response
      Arguments: {"query": "Explain artificial intelligence", "documents": [], "reasoning_steps": []}
      Reasoning: The user is asking for a definition and explanation of AI. Given that has_sufficient_context is false and the suggested method is GEMINI_KNOWLEDGE, I will use generate_response to leverage Gemini's knowledge base to provide the explanation.
      Priority: 1
   2. verify_answer
      Arguments: {"answer": "PLACEHOLDER_FOR_GENERATED_ANSWER", "sources": []}
      Reasoning: After generating the answer, it is essential to verify its accuracy and quality before presenting it to the user. This ensures that the information provided is reliable and meets the user's needs.
      Priority: 2

📋 Reasoning Steps:
   1. [GOAL_ANALYSIS] The user wants a definition and explanation of artificial intelligence.
   2. [CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT] There are no relevant documents in RAG storage and the existing conversations do not provide sufficient context to answer the question directly.
   3. [METHOD_SELECTION] Given the nature of the query (a general knowledge question) and the absence of relevant documents, the best approach is to use the GEMINI_KNOWLEDGE method to generate an informative response.
   4. [TOOL_SEQUENCE] First, I will call generate_response to obtain a definition and explanation of artificial intelligence from Gemini's knowledge base. Then, I will call verify_answer to ensure the generated response is accurate and of high quality.
   5. [PREFERENCE_ALIGNMENT] The user has an intermediate expertise level, so the explanation should be comprehensive yet understandable. The balanced response style will ensure that the answer is presented in a neutral and informative manner. The focus on AI is directly addressed by the query. The tool selection aligns with these preferences.
   6. [DECISION_VERIFICATION] The chosen tools and their sequence will effectively provide the user with a well-defined explanation of artificial intelligence, while considering their stated preferences.

📤 Final Response:

Query: "Explain artificial intelligence"

Answer:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is essentially the broad concept of creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Think of it as teaching computers to 'think' and 'learn'. This doesn't mean robots becoming self-aware and taking over the world (at least not yet!), but rather focusing on specific tasks. 

There are two main categories of AI:

*   **Narrow or Weak AI:** This type of AI is designed and trained for a specific task. Examples include spam filters, recommendation systems (like Netflix suggesting what to watch next), and even self-driving cars (though these are becoming more sophisticated).  These systems excel at their defined task but can't generalize to other areas. Most AI systems we use today fall into this category.

*   **General or Strong AI:** This is the hypothetical type of AI that possesses human-level intelligence.  A strong AI could understand, learn, adapt, and implement knowledge in a wide range of contexts, just like a human. We haven't achieved strong AI yet, and it remains a significant research goal.

Technically, AI achieves its goals through a combination of techniques. Some key ones include:

*   **Machine Learning (ML):**  This involves training algorithms to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  For instance, you can train a machine learning model to recognize cats in images by showing it many pictures of cats and letting it figure out the patterns.
*   **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze data and learn complex patterns. Deep learning powers many advanced AI applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.  DL requires a LOT of data.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  This is what powers chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.

AI is rapidly transforming many industries. From automating tasks and improving efficiency to enabling new products and services, AI's impact on technology and society is growing.  While there are legitimate concerns about the ethical implications of AI (bias, job displacement, etc.), it's undeniable that AI will continue to play a bigger and bigger role in our lives.
