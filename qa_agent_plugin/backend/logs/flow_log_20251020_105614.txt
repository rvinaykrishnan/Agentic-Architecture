🧠 Perception Analysis:
   • Original Query: "Explain artificial intelligence"
   • Analyzed Intent: "The user wants a basic explanation of artificial intelligence."
   • Query Type: FACTUAL
   • Keywords: artificial intelligence, explain, AI
   • Requires Live Data: False
   • Requires Deep Reasoning: True
   • Confidence: 95.0%

📋 Reasoning Steps:
   1. [INTENT_ANALYSIS] The user is asking for an explanation, indicating they want to understand the concept of artificial intelligence. Since they are asking to 'explain', it is a factual question.
   2. [ENTITY_EXTRACTION] The main entity is 'artificial intelligence'. Keywords include 'artificial intelligence', 'explain', and the acronym 'AI'.
   3. [TEMPORAL_CHECK] The query is asking for an explanation of a concept, not for current events or live data. Thus, it doesn't require live data.
   4. [COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT] Since the user didn't specify any particular aspect of AI, a general explanation is sufficient. Given the user's beginner level, a shallow but clear explanation is desired, so deep reasoning to break down the concept is required.
   5. [PREFERENCE_ALIGNMENT] The user preference is for a concise explanation suited for a beginner. Therefore, the response should avoid jargon and complex technical details.
   6. [SELF_VERIFICATION] The analysis aligns with the user's request and preferences. The identified keywords are relevant, and the assessment of the query type and complexity appears accurate.

🤔 Decision Analysis:
   • Should Call Tool: True
   • Number of Tool Calls: 2
   • Needs More Data: False
   • Final Answer Ready: True
   • Confidence: 95.0%

🛠️ Tool Calls Decided:
   1. generate_response
      Arguments: {"query": "Explain artificial intelligence", "documents": [], "reasoning_steps": []}
      Reasoning: The user wants a basic explanation of AI. Since there are no relevant documents in RAG storage and the query type is factual, I will call generate_response to use Gemini knowledge to provide the explanation.
      Priority: 1
   2. verify_answer
      Arguments: {"answer": "", "sources": []}
      Reasoning: This is the final step, verify the answer for quality and accuracy before returning it to the user.
      Priority: 2

📋 Reasoning Steps:
   1. [GOAL_ANALYSIS] The user wants a concise explanation of artificial intelligence suitable for a beginner.
   2. [CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT] We have no relevant documents or memories. The user is a beginner and prefers a concise style.
   3. [METHOD_SELECTION] The query can be answered using general knowledge (GEMINI_KNOWLEDGE) as we lack relevant documents and don't need live data. This aligns with the user's preference for concise answers.
   4. [TOOL_SEQUENCE] I will use generate_response to create the explanation and then verify_answer to check its quality.
   5. [PREFERENCE_ALIGNMENT] The tool selection aligns with the user's beginner level by providing a general explanation. The concise style will be ensured during answer generation.
   6. [DECISION_VERIFICATION] This plan is optimal because it uses the most appropriate method (GEMINI_KNOWLEDGE) given the lack of relevant documents and the user's preferences. It avoids unnecessary tool calls.
