🧠 Perception Analysis:
   • Original Query: "How does photosynthesis work?"
   • Analyzed Intent: "The user wants a description of the process of photosynthesis."
   • Query Type: FACTUAL
   • Keywords: photosynthesis, work, process
   • Requires Live Data: False
   • Requires Deep Reasoning: True
   • Confidence: 98.0%

📋 Reasoning Steps:
   1. [INTENT_ANALYSIS] The user is asking for an explanation of a scientific process. This is a request for factual information.
   2. [ENTITY_EXTRACTION] The key entity is 'photosynthesis'. The words 'how' and 'work' indicate a desire for a process-oriented explanation.
   3. [TEMPORAL_CHECK] Photosynthesis is a well-established scientific process. Current or live data is not required.
   4. [COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT] Explaining photosynthesis requires describing multiple steps, so deep reasoning and a detailed explanation are necessary. The beginner expertise level reinforces the need for a simplified, step-by-step approach.
   5. [PREFERENCE_ALIGNMENT] The user preferences include a beginner expertise level, a concise response style, and an interest in technology (though not directly relevant here, it suggests a possible interest in the technological applications or understanding of photosynthesis). Depth should be shallow but sufficient to explain the core process.
   6. [SELF_VERIFICATION] The analysis correctly identifies the user's need for an explanation of photosynthesis, the lack of temporal relevance, and the requirement for a somewhat detailed but accessible explanation, tailored to a beginner.

🤔 Decision Analysis:
   • Should Call Tool: True
   • Number of Tool Calls: 2
   • Needs More Data: False
   • Final Answer Ready: True
   • Confidence: 95.0%

🛠️ Tool Calls Decided:
   1. generate_response
      Arguments: {"query": "How does photosynthesis work?", "documents": [], "reasoning_steps": []}
      Reasoning: The user is asking a factual question about a well-known process. Since the user has 'beginner' expertise and prefers concise answers and we don't have relevant documents, generating a response directly from Gemini's knowledge is appropriate.
      Priority: 1
   2. verify_answer
      Arguments: {"answer": "placeholder", "sources": []}
      Reasoning: It's crucial to verify the accuracy and quality of the generated response.
      Priority: 2

📋 Reasoning Steps:
   1. [GOAL_ANALYSIS] The user wants a concise explanation of photosynthesis.
   2. [CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT] There are no relevant documents in RAG storage. Previous conversations are related but don't contain the answer. The user is a beginner.
   3. [METHOD_SELECTION] Given the lack of relevant documents and the beginner level of the user, using Gemini's knowledge to generate a simple explanation is most suitable. Since this is general knowledge, we will utilize GEMINI_KNOWLEDGE.
   4. [TOOL_SEQUENCE] First, generate a response using Gemini's knowledge. Then, verify the accuracy of the response.
   5. [PREFERENCE_ALIGNMENT] This approach aligns with the user's preference for concise answers, a beginner level of expertise, and shallow depth. It is a simple explanation about technology.
   6. [DECISION_VERIFICATION] This is the most efficient approach. We are skipping document retrieval because it is not necessary. We are using Gemini's knowledge directly and then verifying the generated answer.

📤 Final Response:

Query: "How does photosynthesis work?"

Answer:
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food (sugar) and oxygen. Think of it like a tiny solar panel – the plant uses the sun's energy to convert these ingredients into energy, much like how AI systems use data to learn.
